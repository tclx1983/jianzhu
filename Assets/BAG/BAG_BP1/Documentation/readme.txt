BAG_BuildingPack1: Metrostructual Decay

Introduction
BAG_BuildingPack1: Metrostructual Decay was designed to be unique, but work well with other building/city asset packs. The focus was to design grungy, navigable buildings which are ideal for 1st and 3rd person shooter style gameplay and to include objects not seen regularly in other asset packs. This collection of static shapes is sure to enhance and urban project that needs some grit to give it realism. 

Installation
Simply doubleclick the .unitypackage to install in your project or do so directly through the Unity Asset Store.

Example Scene
The Example Scene is included with a simple 1st person controller to demonstrate the assets. 

LODs
Each building comes in a high quality version which has all the detail, such as “BagBuilding1High.fbx”. Additionally, there are lower detail versions of each building included (in the LOD folder). The number at the end of each filename indicates a suggested pixel height for that LOD. The higher numbered files have more detail, with the lowest detail files having zero (0) at the end of the filename.

LightMaps
The included light map set is for the example scene and should be recalculated and baked by developers according to their own needs. If using Unity3D free and you want to view the normal maps, in the example scene, you must remove the light maps.

Step Height
The slope limit and step offset have been tweaked in the example scene to make the stairs and ramps more navigable. This will vary depending on character assets used.

Whats Included:

23 unique, multi-story, fully navigable buildings (many with balconies, basements and roof access!). 

Multiple Levels of Detail (LODs) for each building provided as separate meshes (over 90 additional building meshes!).
 
38 additional city prop shapes.

9 ambient decals

Textures 1024x1024 or lower in .png format with normals maps included.

Example Scene with pre-baked dual-lightmaps.
